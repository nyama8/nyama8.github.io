      <p>I am currently a third-year electrical engineering student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/">University of Hawaii at Manoa</a>, where I am fortunate enough to attend as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/studentaffairs/scholarships/raps-overview.php?winners=2016">Regent's Scholar</a>.</p>
      <p>On campus, I work as a tutor at the <a target="_blank" href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/learning/">Learning Assistance Center</a> and as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the UH Manoa <a target="_blank" href="http://ee.hawaii.edu/index.php">Electrical Engineering Department</a>.</p>

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>Currently, my interests most generally lie in the study of physics for applications in the development of novel electronic technologies. I am most interested in the study of physics that would allow for the development of quantum computers, improved solid-state electronics, or other new types of technologies such as polaritonics. In particular: photonics, optoelectronics, and solid-state physics are of the greatest interest to me.</p>
      <p>I still would like to further broaden my experiences in various fields research. So far I have been very fortunate to have experience a variety of subjects including microfluidics, liquid metal RF electronics, and polaritonics. A brief outline of my experiences in these subjects is given below, but due to the proprietary nature of this work I cannot go into much detail.</p>

      <h2>Valley Physics and Polaritonics</h2>

      <p>I was very fortunate to be chosen to participate in Columbia University's <a target="_blank" href="https://mrsec.columbia.edu/reu">MRSEC Research Experience for Undergraduates<a> (REU) program in New York City this past summer (2018). While there I conducted research in Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/vinod-menon-0">Vinod Menon<a>'s Laboratory for Nano and Microphotonics (<a target="_blank" href="http://lanmp.org/">LaNMP</a>) group under mentor Mandeep Khatoniar. While there I studied the valley coherence properties of bilayer tungsten disulfide polaritons.</p>
      <p>Valley polarization is a quantum phenomenon whereby energetically degenerate but k-space distinguishable potential minima in the valence band structure of a material couple to different chiralities of light. Valley coherence is the reemission of that light such that the relative phase between the two chiral components is preserved. Macroscopically this is observed as a preservation of linear polarization of the excitation in the photoluminesence. Such a property is of interest for applications in quantum information processing.</p>
      <p>Polaritons are half-matter-half-light quasi-particles that exist when a light interacting material is placed in a microcavity. Excition-polaritons are a result of the coupling of photons with excitons in semiconducting materials, allowing for the inheritence of the base material's and light's properties. Polaritons can be used to take advantage of the best properties of light and matter simultaneously, including valley coherence.</p>
      <p>In fulfillment of the REU program requirements I was required to write an extended abstract report on my work over the summer as well as a short five minute presentation and poster. As we are looking to publish data shown in these reports I will not be able to make them available yet.</p>
