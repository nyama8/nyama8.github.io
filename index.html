  <h2>About</h2>
  <img class="imgContainer" src="yama_profile.png">
  <p>I am an electrical engineering PhD student in the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/optospintronics-lab/home"> Optical Spintronics and Sensing Lab</a>
    headed by <a target="_blank" href ="https://people.ece.uw.edu/fu_kaimei/">Prof. Kai-Mei Fu</a> at the University of
    Washington. In the spring of 2020, I graduated from the University of Hawai&#699;i at M&#x0101;noa with a BS in
    electrical engineering and minor in physics. I also spent two summers working under
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/vinod-menon-0">Prof. Vinod Menon<a> of the City College of New York's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://lanmp.org/">Laboratory for Nano and Microphotonics (LaNMP)</a>, one of which I was a participant
    of Columbia University's <a target="_blank" href="https://mrsec.columbia.edu/reu">MRSEC REU<a>.
  </p>
  <p>I am very fortunate to be a recipient of the 2020 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"> National Science
    Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. While an undergraduate at the University of Hawaii, I was a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/student-affairs/regents-and-presidential-scholars-program/">
      Regents Scholar</a>.
  </p>
  <p>My research interests are are primarily concerned with the physics and engineering of quantum systems for applications in
    quantum information. Lately I have also become interested communication systems engineering and information theory in the
    context of quantum channels, however this is not my primary research focus. Outside of this field, I have worked on projects
    studying materials and device characterization for reconfigurable electronics using liquid metals.
